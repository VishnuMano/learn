ML Steps
1. Import data
2. Clean data
3. Split data into training/test sets
4. Create a model (algorithms like decision trees or neural nets) - no need to write algorithms from scratch b/c tools like scikit learn can be used
5. Train model
6. Make predictions
7. Evaluate and Improve

Libraries for ML
1. Numpy - provides a multidimensional array
2. Pandas - data analysis library that provides dataframe (2d data structure that is like spreadsheet w/ rows and columns)
3. MatPlotLib - 2d graphing library
4. Scikit-Learn - provides common algorithms like decision trees and neural networks

Anaconda Distribution
- Installs all data science libraries, python, and jupyter notebooks
